With all the excitement over my potential niece/nephew, we're making a baby name generator!
With specific named parameters, this simple project is perfect for demonstrating some concepts like input and constraints to my younger siblings.

The program asks the user for a 1, 2, 3, or any character. If the user entered a 1, that letter will be a vowel. If it's a 2, it'll be a consonant. A 3 will finish the name; any other character will force the letter to be that specific character (or even sequence!).
The screen clears each time a character is entered to keep things tidy, the number of characters in the name is output each time the user enters a new character constraint, and the final name is given when the user enters "3".
